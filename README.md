# sasr Example

A sample R notebook, showing how to execute base SAS code from R interface <be>

## System Requirement:
- Required R package: [sasr](https://github.com/insightsengineering/sasr) <be>
- Required Python packages: [SASPy](https://sassoftware.github.io/saspy/), [Reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) <be>
  
sasr provides an R interface to SAS. In this example, sasr is used as a client to connect to a SAS Viya instance. sasR leverages Reticulate ( toolset for interoperating between R and Python) and SASPy (Python APIs for SAS).

### Note: 
This example assumes that SASPy is configured to connect to a SAS instance. If you do not have SASPy configured, please follow the instructions on the [SASPy](https://sassoftware.github.io/saspy/) page.
