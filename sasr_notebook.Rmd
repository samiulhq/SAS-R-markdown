This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook that shows how R and SAS code can coexist and run within same source file. 


First, we load the [sasr](https://github.com/insightsengineering/sasr) library.sasr library leverages the [saspy](https://github.com/sassoftware/saspy) package which is maintained by sas.

```{r}
library(sasr)
```

Get a sas session. This function returns the last session created or creates a new sas session if there are no previous session
```{r}
my_sas_session <- get_sas_session()
```



Let's run a sas proc. Submitting  code to SAS compute


```{r}

result <- run_sas("
   proc freq data = sashelp.heart;
   tables _CHARACTER_;
   run;
 ")

```
Result contains LOG and LST.
Print Log:
```{r}
cat(result$LOG)

```

Print Result:
```{r}
cat(result$LST)
```

Can we copy sas dataset to R? for this let us produce a output table in SAS WORK library

```{r}
result <- run_sas("
   proc freq data = sashelp.heart;
   tables _CHARACTER_ / out=FreqCount;
   run;
 ")
```

Copy the data 
```{r}
df<- my_sas_session$sd2df("FreqCount",libref="WORK")
print(df)
```
Move some data from R to sas we will move mtcars dataframe available in R to SAS WORK library


```{r}
upload <- my_sas_session$df2sd(mtcars,table ='mt_df',libref='WORK')
```


Now we can run SAS PROCS on WORK.mt_df dataset

```{r}
result <- run_sas("
   proc freq data = work.mt_df;
   tables _NUMERIC_ / out=mean;
   run;
 ")

```

We can check if the tables were created in SAS session

```{r}
my_sas_session$datasets(libref="WORK")
```

Finally, we end the SAS Session

```{r}
my_sas_session$endsas()
rm(my_sas_session)
```
